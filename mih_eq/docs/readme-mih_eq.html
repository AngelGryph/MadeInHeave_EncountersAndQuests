  <p><strong> Version 3 - <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/downloads/#mih_eq">Check for the most recent version</a></strong> <br/>
    <strong>Languages: </strong>English <br/>
    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux </p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod was designed to spice up some encounters I found too easy or otherwise boring, to make certain monsters act more like their P&amp;P counterparts, and to introduce some new encounters, monsters and quests.</p>
  <p>This isn't a strict P&amp;P mod, I use P&amp;P where it makes sense to do so, and deviate when and where needed to allow for engine limitions, avoid frustration, and make things (hopefully) more fun.</p>
  <p>This mod is mainly aimed at people who have multiple quest mods installed and are thus slightly higher in level than normal.  However, this is not a hardcore tactical mod, I don't think I made things too crazy but your milleage may vary.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod has been designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition">BG2EE</acronym> and should be backwards compatible with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2: Throne of Bhaal">BG2: ToB</acronym>.  The mega-mods <acronym title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> are also supported.  This mod is not compatible with older versions of the games or with Tutu.</p>
  <p>As a WeiDU mod, this mod should be compatible with all other WeiDU mods.  There are currently no known conflicts with other mods.  As for installation order, you should install encounters &amp; quests fairly early, before any 'tweak' mods.</p>
  <p>This mod was explicitly made to be compatible with Sword Coast Stratagems, I consider it to be something of a "companion" mod to SCS.  It can be installed either before or after SCS, but installing it before is generally recommended.</p>
  <p>This mod is currently untested with EET, however as far as I know there is nothing in it that requires special treatment under EET so it should work.</p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Before you install</strong><br/>
  If you have an older version of MiH Encounters &amp; Quests, be sure to completely remove it first before trying to install the new version!</p>
  <p><strong>Vanilla BG2 and Baldur's Gate Trilogy</strong><br/>
  Before installing this mod, you must install the latest official patch, and you must also install the Throne of Bhaal Extender (ToBEx) and the G3 Fixpack version 11 or higher.  This mod will not work correctly without those two installed!</p>
  <p><strong>BG1EE and Siege of Dragonspear</strong><br/>
  If you obtained your version of the game through Steam or GoG, you must run a program called 'modmerge' before installing any WeiDU mods like this one.  If you obtained your game from Beamdog, this is not required.</p>
  <p><strong>BG2EE and Extended Edition Trilogy</strong><br/>
  There are no requirements at this time.  For EET, install this mod after EET has been installed but before the EET installation is finalized.</p>
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br/>
Made in Heaven: Encounters &amp; Quests is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a zip archive.  Modern versions of Windows have support for zip files built in, just double-click the archive to open it, and extract the contents to your game file.  If you are still using an older version of Windows, you should install WinZip or a similar program to extract the archive.</p>
  <p>Your game folder should then contain a mih_eq folder and setup-mih_eq.exe. To install, double-click setup-mih_eq.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-mih_eq.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall, or otherwise change components.  To uninstall the entire mod without questions, run setup-mih_eq.exe --uninstall from a command line in your game directory.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br/>
    Made in Heaven: Encounters &amp; Quests is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a compressed archive.  Extract the contents of the archive and move them to your game folder. Your game folder should then contain a mih_eq folder, setup-mih_eq, and setup-mih_eq.command. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-mih_eq.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br/>
    Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game installation directory.</p>
  <p>If you haven't already, download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">weidu.org</a> and extract (at least) the weidu executable to a $PATH directory (e.g. /usr/bin).</p>
  <p>To install, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory and
 run <strong>weidu --log setup-mih_eq.debug mih_eq/setup-mih_eq.tp2</strong> from your game installation directory to install or uninstall the mod.</p>
  <p>Note: The readme files of some older mods recommend running tolower on Linux prior to installation.  <b>Don't do this on an Enhanced Edition game, you will break it!</b>  Modern versions of tolower will actually refuse to run in a EE game directory.  At any rate, the contents of MiH: Encounters &amp; Quests are already all lower case, there is no need for tolower.</p>
  <p><strong>New Game required!</strong><br/>
  After installing this mod you must start a new game.  This mod edits area files and stores, both of which are stored in your save game after you have visited them.  Continuing a saved game after installing this mod will have unexpected and likely undesired results.</p>
</div>
<h2>Component Descriptions</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod consists of several components, each of which can be installed or removed independently from the others.<p>
  <h3>Monster Enhancements</h3>
  <p>These modifications try to make certain monsters a bit more accurate to their pen &amp; paper counterparts and as a result a little more challenging.  In these I try to stay as close to pen &amp; paper as I can.</p>
  <p><strong>P&amp;P Ankhegs</strong><br/>
  In the game, ankhegs fire their spittle at you like machine guns, but according to the Monstrous Manual they cannot actually do that.  This modification changes their spittle to a single-target breath weapon they can deploy only once every six hours, and they will do so when low on HP.  To make up for this, they are given an 18/50 strength, making them more dangerous in melee.</p>
  <p>Additionally, ankhegs can have from 3 to 8 HD.  The ones in the games have the abilities of 8 HD monsters but are treated as having only 3 HD (thus making them vulnerable to Sleep).  This component makes them proper 8 HD monsters.  For the original saga, lesser versions (3-7 HD) are added to the ankheg pit dungeon in Farmer Brun's quest.<p/>
  <p>Tactical advice: Since you can no longer fully avoid the acid spittle, damage tends to accumulate rapidly in repeated encounters, making especially the ankheg pit quite dangerous.  Scrolls of Acid Resistance, or the Oil of Acid Resistance from my item pack are strongly recommended.</p>
  <p><strong>P&amp;P Basilisks</strong><br/>
  According to P&amp;P, greater basilisks have a deadly poisonous breath in addition to their stone gaze and poisoned claws.  This modification implements this in the form of a deadly gas cloud similar to iron golems.  In addition, they get dragon-like immunities (specifically, they get the "dragring" pseudo-item).  Note that on EE games this makes them immune to normal arrows.</p>
  <p>Tactical advice: Get Protection from Poison scrolls for your melee fighters or be ready with Neutralize Poison and Elixirs of Health.  Keep everyone else far, far away.  Be especially careful when you encounter them in close quarters.</p>
  <p><strong>P&amp;P Oozes, Slimes and Jellies</strong><br/>
  This currently affects gray oozes, ochre jellies and mustard jellies.  Jelly splitting is currently not implemented as I haven't been able to get it right yet, but will be added in the future.<p>
  <p><i>Gray Ooze:</i>A gray ooze's touch deals 2d8 acid damage.  They are completely immune to fire, cold, missile damage and all spells.</p>
  <p><i>Ochre Jelly:</i>The touch of this jelly deals 1d10 acid damage.  They are completely immune to missile damage and electricity.</p>
  <p><i>Mustard Jelly:</i>This jelly deals 5d4 acid damage with its touch.  It surrounds itself with a cloud of gas that makes nearby creatures lethargic (slow and tired) unless they are immune to disease.  A mustard jelly is not immune to magic but it has 10% magic resistance and is fully immune to Magic Missile and similar spells, as well as arrows and bullets.  Being intelligent, the mustard jelly attempts to hide itself when not in melee, with 90% stealth.</p>
  <p>Tactical advice: As long as you keep their changed resistances in mind, these should not be significantly harder than normal.  Since they all deal acid damage now, you might want to invest in some acid resistance.</p>
  <p><strong>P&amp;P Dread Wolves</strong><br/>
  The games treat dread wolves more or less as normal wolves, but they are actually supposed to be hard to kill undead creatures.  Dread wolves regerate like trolls and will get up again once downed unless you quickly apply fire or acid.  However, unlike trolls they will only get up once.  Their bite carries a disease that makes the victim lose one HP per hour unless cured.  (Out of mercy to low-level parties without ready access to Cure Disease, the victim will recover after 8 hours.)</p>
  <p>Tactical advice: Be careful with these at lower levels, their disease can be deadly.  If they go down, try to hit them immediately with a fire- or acid arrow to finish them.  Also keep in mind that they are undead and can thus be turned.</p>
  <p><strong>P&amp;P Winter Wolves</strong><br/>
  This component makes the breath of winter wolves a proper breath weapon that can affect multiple targets and requires no attack roll.  This makes them very dangerous to low-level parties, so out of mercy I remove them from the Nashkel Mine and surrounding areas, Fireleaf Forest and Dryad Falls.  To compensate, you will have guaranteed encounters with them in the Gibberling Mountains.  This behavior can be turned off in the ini file if desired.</p>
  <p>Tactical advice: Avoid them until you are at least level 3 or so.  Go get the Boots of the North (or the Ring of Warmth from my item pack) as soon as you can, and find some Scrolls- or Potions of Cold Resistance.</p>
  <p><strong>P&amp;P Wraith Spiders</strong><br/>
  The game treats them as normal giant spiders, but wraith spiders are actually undead.  This will alter the wraith spider's bite to have its proper effects: 1d4 cold damage, one level drained and two points of Constitution damage unless the victim saves versus poison or is immune to disease.  They are also now properly flagged as undead.</p>
  <p>Tactical advice: These are rather rare encounters and while that bite can be crippling they are not harder than usual to deal with.  You should not have much trouble.</p>
  <p><strong>Improved Vampire Abilities &amp; Resistances</strong><br/>
  This component gives vampires additional resistances based on their statistics in the Ravenloft setting.  It does not currently give them new offensive abilities, but it can be combined with mods like Quest Pack or Sword Coast Stratagems that do.  Ravenloft vampires take half damage from all offensive magic (implemented as 50% reistance to fire, cold, acid, lightning and magical damage) and a +4 on their saving throws against damaging spells (implemented as +4 versus Invocation on EE, +4 versus Spells on the old engine).  They are also immune to being turned, and get a stat boost depending on their age category.</p>
  <p>Tactical advice: These make vampires very dangerous, especially combined with one of the AI-enhancing mods like SCS.  Invest heavily in anti-undead weaponry and protection items, and never take them on unprepared.</p>
  <p><strong>Improved Golem Abilities &amp; Resistances</strong><br/>
  Similar to the vampires component, this gives the most common golems additional resistances and some stat boosts.  A few golems also gain additional abilities as well.</p>
  <p><i>Flesh Golem:</i> These creatures gain 50% resistance to cold and electricity and the following stats: str 19, dex 18, con 18, int 14, wis 2, cha 6.  In addition they get the salient ability <i>hyper regeneration</i>, which revives them after a while unless destroyed with fire or acid.</p>
  <p><i>Clay Golem:</i> These monsters get 50% resistance to crushing weapons (note that other wweapons can't damage them at all) and immunity to acid.  However, they are no longer immune to fire and cold.  They have these stats: str 20, dex 16, con 20, int 10, wis 2, cha 5.</p>
  <p><i>Stone Golem:</i> Due to their stone construction, these get 90% resistance to slashing, piercing and missile damage, and 50% resistance to fire, cold, lightning and acid.  Their stats are: str 22, dex 17, con 20, int 9, wis 2, cha 8.</p>
  <p><i>Iron Golem:</i> These titans gain 80% resistance to all weapons, but they lose their immunity to acid and lightning.  Their stats are str 24, dex 17, con 20, int 9, wis 2, cha 7.</p>
  <p><i>Brain Golem:</i> These horrid creations of the illithid get a few psionic abilities like their masters.  They project an inertial barrier which makes them immune to missiles and halves all other damage to them, and they can utilize a psionic blast like their creators once per turn.  Their stats are str 20, dex 14, con 20, int 14, wis 2, cha 3.</p>
  <p><i>Bone Golem:</i> These skeletal abominations emit a horrid laugh once every three rounds with paralyzes everyone who fails their saving throw.  Those who fail by 4 or more are instantly slain instead.  However, they lose their immunity to lightning and acid and actually become quite vulnerable to fire.  Their stats are str 19, dex 18, con 20, int 12, wis 2, cha 3.</p>
  <p><i>Magic Golem:</i>The attack of these monsters ignores all magical enhancements to armor class (implemented as a flat +10 to hit) and their attack will now dispel magic on the target in additon to draining wizard spells and item charges.  The item- and spell drain no longer allow a saving throw.  Once per day they can unleash a random magical effect.  Their stats are str 19, dex 16, con 20, int 6, wis 4, cha 5.</p>
  <p>Tactical advice: While still mostly their stupid old selves, these resistances and abilities make golems a genuine threat.  You may have to exploit their weak points, but keep in mind that they still are immune to spells cast directly at them.  You may have to get a little creative here.  Weapons that deal additional elemental damage may help.</p>
  <p><strong>Improved Lich Abilities &amp; Resistances</strong><br/>
  This component adds a small amount of additional resistances to liches.  They gain 50% resistance to slashing-, piercing- and missile damage, and are made resistant to low-level spells (default up to 3rd, can be changed in the ini file).  It also ensures they are at least high enough level to cast their most powerful memorized spells, this will also adjust their thac0, saves, hit points and xp value accordingly.</p>
  <p>Note: In vanilla BG2, liches are already immune to spells up to 5th level, this component may lower that.  The SCS mod takes this immunity away, install this component after SCS to (partially) restore it.</p>
  <h3>Tactical Challenges: Original Saga</h3>
  <p>These components enhance certain battles in the Original Saga (BG1 and Tales of the Sword Coast).  Expect to see new enemies, more enemies, stronger enemies or any compination thereof.  However, I do not make major modifications in AI scripts, mostly because I don't know how to.  Use SCS or another mod for that.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Candlekeep Catacombs</strong><br/>
  This component enhances the various encounters in the catacombs under Candlekeep, visited in chapter 6.  There will be more and stronger undead on the first level, more dopplegangers and a few other surprises on the second level, more spiders on the third level, and a final surprise as you leave Candlekeep.  However, some help is available: Arkanis and Deder are much better prepared for their task and if you convince them to help you can control them like party members.</p>
  <p><i>New enemies: Wight, Greater Wight.</i></p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Mutamin's Garden</strong><br/>
  This is the area with the basilisks east of the Song of the Morning Temple.  Expect many more basilisks and a few other surprises...
  <p><i>New enemies: Dracolisk, <strike>Pyrolisk</strike> (not implemented yet).</i></p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Ramazith's Tower</strong><br/>
  This is the tower of Ramazith just north of the Three Kegs, visited during the nymph's quest.  The enemies on the various floors are mostly pathetic, this component spices that up a great deal.  Expect some serious resistance here.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: The Spider Plague</strong><br/>
  This modification affects two areas, the Spider Wood to the far east of the Friendly Arm Inn (with the Red Wizards) and the second part of the Cloakwood.  The game manual mentions a spider plague going on, so this modification makes it so that you will be facing a lot of spiders in these areas.  Spider will spawn continuously offscreen to a certain maximum.  At higher difficulties, more dangerous spiders will spawn occasionally as well.</p>
  <p><i>New enemies: Hairy Spider</i></p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Ulcaster Ruins</strong><br/>
  This modification adds some unique new enemies to the Ulcaster ruins, and in general spices things up quite a bit in there.</p>
  <p><i>New enemies: Blazing Bones.</i></p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Xvart Village</strong><br/>
  The xvart village is due west of Nashkel.  Let's face it, even at low levels this place is a joke.  The xvarts here (xvart2.cre) are worth slightly more XP - but have the same stats as any other xvart.  This mod gives them an extra hit dice, and their leader Nexlit is made into a proper 4th level fighter.  It's still not very difficult, but at least no longer a complete curb stomp battle.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Zombie Farm</strong><br/>
  This is the farm all the way at the north end of the map, where the farmer Wenric asks you to kill 20 zombies for 150gp.  By the time you get here, zombies are no threat whatsoever.  This component changes them to more dangerous ju-ju zombies and more than doubles their number, hopefully making it a bit more of an actual challenge.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Durlag's Tower</strong><br/>
  The main dungeon of Tales of the Sword Coast is a fair challenge, but not that hard for veteran players.  This modificiation hopefully spices things up a notch or two.  Ghasts in the upper levels of the tower become the tougher fell ghasts, crypt crawlers get a little stronger and there will be more enemies everywhere, including some new ones.<p>
  <p><i>New enemies: Barrow Wight, Crystal Ooze, Dracolisk.</i></p>
  <h3>Encounters &amp; Quests: Original Saga</h3>
  <p>These components aren't so much about tactics (although there usually is some combat) but extend or tweak an existing encounter or quest, or add a new one.</p>
  <p><strong>The Surgeon's Plight</strong><br/>
  The Surgeon, Davaeorn's brother, is an interesting character but unfortunately the game never expands on him beyond the first encounter.  This component adds a possible new encounter with him in Cloakwood, where he might provide some help now that your quest has crossed with his.</p>
  <p>This component is compatible with the BG1 Romantic Encounters mod, they can be installed in any order.</p>
  <p><strong>The Cloakwood Assassins</strong><br/>
  This component adds an encounter with a new group of assassins in Cloakwood, beyond the first bridge in the wyvern area.  Surely you you can defeat a few more of these rabble, no?</p>
  <p><strong>Minor Quest Tweaks (BG1)</strong><br/>
  This is a small collection of minor tweaks to existing quests, mostly to reduce frustration or close a pothole or two.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Ulcaster's Ghost: Ulcaster will now immediately ask for the book, you don't need to continue prodding him.</li>
  <li>Gerde and the Ankhegs: Gerde and the ankhegs she wants kiiled won't spawn until you have talked to Fenten in Baldur's Gate.</li>
  <li>Nester's Dagger: The ankheg that drops Nester's dagger won't spawn until you talked with Quinn in Baldur's Gate, and the dagger gets a unique icon.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Tactical Challenges: Siege of Dragonspear</h3>
  <p>These components enhance certain battles in the Siege of Dragonspear extention to Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition.  Siege of Dragonspear has some very large battles since the newer engine handles multiple enemies much better, and these components take advantage of that as well.</p>
  <p><strong>Increase Enemy Group Size</strong><br/>
  The enemy groups in Siege of Dragonspear scale depending on the current difficulty level, by having some enemies silently self-destruct at certain difficulty levels.  This component changes some scripts to enlarge the enemy groups.  Current default is to have no enemies remove themselves and thus always have the maximum number of enemies.  This can be changed in the ini file.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Korlasz' Tomb</strong><br/>
  Korlasz's Tomb is pretty pathetic even for a starter dungeon, no challenge at all for a party that went through Durlag's Tower and Balduran's Isle.  This modification seeks to make it a proper challenge.  The mercenaries on the upper level gain several levels (default 5, configurable in the ini file) to put them more on par with the party, while the number of undead on the lower level is increased and some stronger undead appear along with a few other surprises...</p>
  <p><i>New enemies: Barrow Wight, Mohrg.</i></p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Dwarven Dig Site</strong><br/>
  This is the optional dungeon near the first Flaming Fist camp, with the dwarves of Dumathoin and the Coldhearth Lich.  It is already a fairly interesting dungeon with a few decent battles, but I think it could still use some spicing up.  Expect to see a few new undead and other creatures with unusual abilities.</p>
  <p><i>New enemies: Blazing Bones, Huecuva, Stone Snake.</i></p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Vampire Encounters</strong><br/>
  There are two unique vampire encounters in Siege of Dragonspear, Tsolak and the unnamed vampire in the Trollbark forest.  Unfortunately, a single fledgling vampire just isn't a match for a decently equipped level 7-9 party, so this modificcation spices things up a bit to hopefully make them a decent challenge.</p>
  <p>Tsolak is given the stats of a very old vampire: HD 11+1, str 18/00, con 18, dex 18, int 18, cha 17, SA: level drain (3 levels), SD: +2 required to hit, MR 20%.  The dire wolves he summons are a bit stronger and tougher than normal ones.  He may also have one last trick up his sleeve...</p>
  <p>The Trollbark vampire is an old vampire: HD 10+2, str 18/00, con 18, dex 17, int 17, cha 16, SA: level drain (2 levels), SD: +2 required to hit, MR 10%.  He has a few fledgling vampire thralls.</p>
  <p>Note that Tsolak and the Trollbark vampire also benefit from the Improved Vampire Resistances component, further toughening them.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Cyric's Temple</strong><br/>
  This is the old temple to Bhaal near Bridgefort, now taken over by worshippers of Cyric.  It's already a nice challenge, having a dragon, a half-dragon and a mind flayer encounter, but I still thought there was some room for a little more...</p>
  <p>The green dragon Morentherene gets extra hit points and a slightly more powerful breath weapon.  She will now also always be assisted with some young green dragons, which have also been beefed slightly.</p>
  <p>The half-dragon Ziatar gets some beefy lizard men as backup, and the rest of the temple also has a few additional guardians.</p>
  <p><i>New enemies: Caryatid Column.</i></p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Bridgefort</strong><br/>
  This component enhances a few battles taking place in and around Bridgefort.  The dark wraith summoned by the voidstone gains extra HD and a few resistances to make it a bit more dangerous, and the false priest of Lathander now deploys slightly stronger undead monsters.</p>
  <h3>Encounters &amp; Quests: Siege of Dragonspear</h3>
  <p>These components aren't so much about tactics (although there usually is some combat) but extend or tweak an existing encounter or quest, or add a new one.</p>
  <p><strong>Complete more/all Zaviak's Vision Quests</strong><br/>
  This component gives the Spectacles of Spectacle more charges (default 9, configurable in the ini file), allowing you to complete more of Zaviak's vision quests.  The default lets you complete all available quests, although you still have to choose between the two possible ones in Dead Men's Pass.</p>
  <h3>Tactical Challenges: Shadows of Amn</h3>
  <p>These components add tactical challenges to the Shadows of Amn portion of Baldur's Gate 2, mostly by adding more and stronger enemies.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Graveyard Catacombs</strong><br/>
  This component enhances the various battles in the catacombs below the graveyard district, including the battles with Bodhi at the ends of chapters 3 and 6.</p>
  <p>You'll see some new undead enemies if you go for the Book of Kazaa and/or the Nether Scroll.  Bodhi's grim warders have gained a few levels, and there will be more and stronger vampires and other undead in her lair.</p>
  <p><i>New enemies: Barrow Wight, Mohrg.</i></p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Lower Reaches</strong><br/>
  The lower reaches are the dungeon beneath the temple district, where the cult of the Unseeing Eye is and where the Rift Device is stored.  You'll see more and stronger undead in the ghoul town, and the random encounters in the rift cavern have been made more logical with the plot and are beefed up a bit.</p>
  <p><i>New enemies: Barrow Wight, Mohrg.</i></p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Slum Sewers</strong><br/>
  This is the sewer section between the Copper Coronet and the Slaver Stockade, where Lilarcor is hidden.  You'll see creatures that are more appropriate to being in a slimy sewer, and lots more of them.</p>
  <p><i>New enemies: Crystal Ooze.</i></p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Trademeet</strong><br/>
  This component enhances a few encounters in Trademeet.  The skindancers get a power boost to make them actually dangerous, and the trademeet tomb has had an area added to it to make room for some extra encounters.</p>
  <p><i>New enemies: Barrow Wight, Huecuva, Mohrg.</i></p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Temple Ruins</strong><br/>
  These are the ruins in the Umar Hills, where the Shade Lord and the Shadow Dragon have set up shop.</p>
  <p>You'll encounter many shadows and shadow wolves while making your way to the temple, they spawn in greater numbers than before.  Inside the temple you should see vastly more undead, including some new types.</p>
  <p>The Shade Lord is unchanged (SCS already does a great job enhancing it), but the battle with the shadow dragon has been enhanced by adding backup minions for the monster; various shadow creatures will now spawn during the battle.</p>
  <p><i>New enemies: Barrow Wight, Mohrg.</i></p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Firkraag's Lair</strong><br/>
  This enhances the various encounters in the Windspear Hills, especially in the dungeon where Firkraag lairs.  Firkraag himself has also been beefed up considerably.</p>
  <p>Prepare to see some old "friends" in the hills, basilisks are now among the randomly spawning monsters and are guarding Firkraag's lair.  In the mist cavern you will now see less hobgoblins, but many more mist creatures, some rather dangerous ones. And King Strohm's tomb has more guardians now, mostly various undead.</p>
  <p>Should you return to the lair later on, to deal with Firkraag for example, you may find he has had the time to deploy some new recruits.  And if you take on Firkraag himself, you will find that he is no longer too proud to throw a bunch of minions and some of his prized golems at you as well.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Spellhold</strong><br/>
  This enhances few battles in and around the asylum.  Both the Pirate Lord and lady Galvena have been made higher level, and you will see many more creatures inside the asylum, including some new ones.  However, the battle with Irenicus is not touched, that I gladly leave to SCS.</p>
  <p><i>New enemies: Brass Minotaur.</i></p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Underdark</strong><br/>
  This component enhances various Underdark encounters, including those in Ust Natha and in the beholder- and illithid lairs.  Expect some heavy resistance here.</p>
  <p>Kuo-toa gain several levels (default 6, configurable in the ini file) to bring their threat level somewhat on par with the drow, beholders and illithid.  In the illithid lair,the ogre servant and insane dwarf encounters have been beefed up considerably and you will see many more mind flayers as well as some very strong umber hulks.</p>
  <p>In Ust Natha, the battle with the lich Deirex has been enhanced and he has gained the Animate Dead salient ability.  He will constantly spawn undead minions in addition to casting his spells.</p>
  <p><i>New enemies: Mohrg.</i></p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Athkatla Liches</strong><br/>
  This component enhances the battles with some of the liches lurking in Athkatla.  Currently this affects the Shade Lich and Elemental Lich, but I will likely add others in later versions.</p>
  <p>The Elemental Lich is now immune to most elemental attacks (fire, cold, lightning and acid and resists slashing- and piercing attacks.  He has gained the salient ability to regenerate 2 hp per round.  During the battle various elemental creatures will spawn.</p>
  <p>The Shade Lich now takes half damage from most sources except crushing attacks, and also has the salient ability to regenerate 2 hp per round.  During the battle, various creatures from the shadow plane will spawn.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Suldanessenar</strong><br/>
  <p>Currently this only enhances the batle with Irenicus' black dragon, but I may add other enhancements in the future once I think of some.</p>
  <p>The black dragon will now be assisted by a variety of swamp creatures, including shambling mounds, earth elementals, and brown puddings.</p>
  <p><i>New enemies: Brown Pudding.</i></p>
  <h3>Tactical Challenges: Throne of Bhaal</h3>
  <p>These components seek to make the high-level battles in Throne of Bhaal challenging and interesting.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Watcher's Keep</strong><br/>
  This component aims to make some of the Watcher's Keep battles more interesting by adding more and/or stronger monsters.</p>
  <p>The random spawns on the floor of the Machine of Lum the Mad have been made both more dangerous and more appropriate to the theme of the level.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Pocket Plane</strong><br/>
  This component seeks to make some of the challenge battles in the pocket plane a little more interesting and challenging.<p>
  <p><i>Test of Retribution:</i> The creatures spawned in the good path are much more dangerous.  Expect to see beholders, illithid and umber hulks instead of kobolds, dopplegangers and gnolls.  (Evil path yet to do.)</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Battles: Saradush</strong><br/>
  This seeks to make the battles during the siege in Saradush more interesting.<p>
  <p><i>Gromnir's Barracks:</i>Gromnir's mercenaries gain a bunch of levels (default 8, configurable in the ini file) to make them at least something of a threat to epic level characters.  Area of effect spells are highly recommended here.</p>
  <p><i>Sewer Shadows:</i> More shadows will now spawn during the battle with Yaga-Shura's sappers, including a few fairly dangerous versions.</p>
  <p><i>Cursed Prison:</i> The other path into Saradush castle is now home to high-level vampires and the entire prison is now a desecrated zone, strengthening undead and gradually draining the living.  You should not stay around longer than needed.</p>
  <h3>Encounters &amp; Quests: Throne of Bhaal</h3>
  <p>These modifications extend existing quests or add new encounters and quests in the Throne of Bhaal portion,  including Watcher's Keep.</p>
  <p><strong>Minor Quest Tweaks (ToB)</strong><br/>
  This is just a small collection of quality of life hacks for Throne of Bhaal.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The Thieves' Hood: You can now always get the Thieves' Hood from the fiends in the maze of Watcher's Keep, even if you are a paladin and have to fight them both.</li>
  <li>Saladrex' Loot: Some of Saladrex' loot is now stealable by a good thief.  Mostly done because I just don't like killing him for his stuff.</li>
  </ul>
