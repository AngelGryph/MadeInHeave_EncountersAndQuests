  <p><strong> Version 3 - <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/downloads/#mih_eq">Check for the most recent version</a></strong> <br/>
    <strong>Languages: </strong>English <br/>
    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux </p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod was designed to spice up some encounters I found too easy or otherwise boring, to make certain monsters act more like their P&amp;P counterparts, and to introduce some new encounters, monsters and quests.</p>
  <p>This isn't a strict P&amp;P mod, I use P&amp;P where it makes sense to do so, and deviate when and where needed to allow for engine limitions, avoid frustration, and make things (hopefully) more fun.</p>
  <p>Currently this mod covers only the original saga (BG1) and, to a limited extend, Siege of Dragonspear.  I plan to later extend it to Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal (BG2) as well, and perhaps even to Icewind Dale.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod has been designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition">BG2EE</acronym> and should be backwards compatible with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2: Throne of Bhaal">BG2: ToB</acronym>.  The mega-mods <acronym title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> are also supported.  This mod is not compatible with older versions of the games.
  <p>As a WeiDU mod, this mod should be compatible with all other WeiDU mods.  There are currently no known conflicts with other mods.  As for installation order, you should install encounters &amp; quests fairly early, before any 'tweak' mods.</p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Before you install</strong><br/>
  If you have an older version of MiH Encounters &amp; Quests, be sure to completely remove it first before trying to install the new version!</p>
  <p><strong>Vanilla BG2 and Baldur's Gate Trilogy</strong><br/>
  Before installing this mod, you must install the latest official patch, and you must also install the Throne of Bhaal Extender (ToBEx) and the G3 Fixpack version 11 or higher.  This mod will not work correctly without those two installed!</p>
  <p><strong>BG1EE and Siege of Dragonspear</strong><br/>
  If you obtained your version of the game through Steam or GoG, you must run a program called 'modmerge' before installing any WeiDU mods like this one.  If you obtained your game from Beamdog, this is not required.</p>
  <p><strong>BG2EE and Extended Edition Trilogy</strong><br/>
  There are no requirements at this time.  For EET, install this mod after EET has been installed but before the EET installation is finalized.</p>
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br/>
Made in Heaven: Encounters &amp; Quests is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a zip archive.  Modern versions of Windows have support for zip files built in, just double-click the archive to open it, and extract the contents to your game file.  If you are still using an older version of Windows, you should install WinZip or a similar program to extract the archive.</p>
  <p>Your game folder should then contain a mih_eq folder and setup-mih_eq.exe. To install, double-click setup-mih_eq.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-mih_eq.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall, or otherwise change components.  To uninstall the entire mod without questions, run setup-mih_eq.exe --uninstall from a command line in your game directory.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br/>
    Made in Heaven: Encounters &amp; Quests is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a compressed archive.  Extract the contents of the archive and move them to your game folder. Your game folder should then contain a mih_eq folder, setup-mih_eq, and setup-mih_eq.command. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-mih_eq.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br/>
    Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game installation directory.</p>
  <p>If you haven't already, download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">weidu.org</a> and extract (at least) the weidu executable to a $PATH directory (e.g. /usr/bin).</p>
  <p>To install, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory and
 run <strong>weidu --log setup-mih_eq.debug mih_eq/setup-mih_eq.tp2</strong> from your game installation directory to install or uninstall the mod.</p>
  <p>Note: The readme files of some older mods recommend running tolower on Linux prior to installation.  <b>Don't do this on an Enhanced Edition game, you will break it!</b>  Modern versions of tolower will actually refuse to run in a EE game directory.  At any rate, the contents of MiH: Encounters &amp; Quests are already all lower case, there is no need for tolower.</p>
  <p><strong>New Game required!</strong><br/>
  After installing this mod you must start a new game.  This mod edits area files and stores, both of which are stored in your save game after you have visited them.  Continuing a saved game after installing this mod will have unexpected and likely undesired results.</p>
</div>
<h2>Component Descriptions</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod consists of several components, each of which can be installed or removed independently from the others.<p>
  <h3>Baldur's Gate 1 - Original Saga</h3>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Candlekeep Catacombs</strong><br/>
  For an end-game dungeon I always found the Candlekeep catacombs a little too easy with only the relatively weak ghasts and dopplegangers.  This component introduces some more powerful undead in the first section (you might want to bring scrolls of Restoration).  The second section has a few new doppleganger encounters (one that I found in the game files and was apparently cut, and two of my own design).  More importantly, Arkanis and Deder are now much better prepared for their task and if they join up with you you will be able to control them as if they are party members.  And don't expect to be completely safe once you're back above ground...</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Mutamin's Garden</strong><br/>
  Ah, Mutamin's garden, normally an XP bonanza with little risk as soon as you get some decent protection from petrification.  This component introduces a few new opponents that are on-par with greater basilisks XP-wise but not so easily routed...  If you combine this with Enhanced Basilisks below, Mutamin's Garden becomes very deadly indeed.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Ramazith's Tower</strong><br/>
  Ramazith, the wizard who turned Vail's party to stone and summoned the green slimes into Ye Olde Tavern, sounds like a very dangerous guy to mess with.  Yet his tower barely reflects that, putting you only against weak kobolds and hobgoblins.  Well, no longer says I!  Expect lots of slimes and some other nasty surprises as you scale the floors.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Thieves' Maze and Undercity</strong><br/>
  For a final dungeon, this place is actually rather boring.  I added more opponents in the maze, and in the Undercity you can no longer just waltz into the temple as Sarevok now had the sense to lock the door behind him.  You will have to do some exploring, and there now will be more than weak zombies and skeletons prowling around...</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Ulcaster Ruins</strong><br/>
  The ghost of Ulcaster will now make his request immediately instead of having to be pestered a few times about it.  The dungeon now has a couple of new and fairly dangerous unique enemies</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Xvart Village</strong><br/>
  The xvarts are increased in number and now have the sense to guard the entrances to their village.  Nexlit has been given a better weapon and a few levels in fighter, and some of the other xvarts (those with higher than normal XP values) are a little tougher as well.  It's still perfectly doable at level 1-3 but you might want to be a little more careful.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Zombie Farm</strong><br/>
  In my opinion, this is a wasted area with weak opponents and one boring quest with a mediocre reward.  For now I give the zombies the stats of ju-ju zombies, making them at least a bit more of a fight.  I'm still contemplating what else I can do here, suggestions are welcome!</p>
  <p><strong>A Real Spider Plague</strong><br/>
  The manual and some characters mention that parts of the wood are infested with spiders.  This makes them a real plague, in some areas spiders will be constantly spawning and you will have to be on your toes.  Centeol also gets a little more backup.</p>
  <p><strong>Cloakwood Assassins</strong><br/>
  This component introduces a new group of assassins who will be waiting for your party in the Cloakwood.  It's (hopefully) a diverting but not super-difficult fight, a refreshing break from battling the local wildlife.</p>
  <p><strong>The Surgeon's Plight</strong><br/>
  The surgeon is an interesting character but gets little closure.  With this mod he will play a slightly larger role.  To start it, you must have encountered The Surgeon before you head to Cloakwood, and you must ask him to tell his story.  Doing so may get you a helpful ally.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Minor BG1 Quests</strong><br/>
  These are some minor tweaks to existing quests that are too small by themselves to warrant a separate component.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Gerde and the ankhegs she wants you to kill won't spawn until you've talked to Fenten in Baldur's Gate, making their related quests flow a bit smoother.</li>
  <li>Quint's ankheg behind Tanya's house won't spawn until you have met him, and gets a little backup.  Nestor's dagger gets a unique bam and a different description to make it more obvious that it's something special.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Baldur's Gate 1 - Tales of the Sword Coast</h3>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Durlag's Tower</strong><br/>
  While this place is already plenty deadly, I felt there was some room for improvement.  Expect more varied and slightly more powerful opponents in most areas.</p>
  <h3>Baldur's Gate 1 - Siege of Dragonspear</h3>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Korlasz' Tomb</strong><br/>
  Korlasz' minions aren't really much of a challenge for a level 7-8 party that has been through Durlag's Tower.  This modification tries to make the starter dungeon of Siege of Dragonspear a bit more of a thrill.</p>
  <h3>Baldur's Gate 2 - Shadows of Amn</h3>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Ancient Tomb</strong><br/>
  This component slightly enhances the ancient tombs underneath the Athkatla graveyard district, adding a few more encounters here and there.  Bodhi's lair will also have a few more opponents, and one illogically placed spawn trap is moved to a location where you will be more likely to encounter it.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Firkraag's Lair</strong><br/>
  This component enhances Firkraag's lair in the Umar Hills.  The Umar Hills spawn a wider selection of slightly stronger monsters, and see the return of a dangerous monster not seen since BG1, so better be prepared!  Inside King Strohm's tomb you will now encounter some creatures that were previously unused in the game.  The rest of the lair is mostly unchanged, but you may see some more orcs than before.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Lower Reaches</strong><br/>
  This component enhances the encounters in the Lower Reaches, where the first half of the Rift Device is stored.  The spawn points have been altered to spawn more logical creatures, the hand trap now spawns wraith spiders instead of huge ones, and the high-level trap after the bridge puzzle now spawns undead instead of beholders, as at this point the Unseeing Eye doesn't want to stop you yet.  the will also be more undead in the optional Undead City below the cult's lair.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Shadow Temple</strong><br/>
  With this, the temple ruins in the Umar Hills will have more varied undead encounters, and a few extra ones including a new high-level encounter.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Slum Sewers</strong><br/>
  This component enhances the sewers underneath the Copper Coronet, replacing a few illogical encounters with more sensible ones, and adding a few new monsters.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Trademeet Tomb</strong><br/>
  This component expands the family crypt you visit during the feuding families quest in Trademeet.  Its has been expanded with a new area and you should expect much more oposition than just a few fairly weak skeletons.</p>
  <h3>Baldur's Gate 2 - Throne of Bhaal</h3>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Forest of Mir</strong><br/>
  This component introduces new, powerful undead monsters to the old Bhaal temple in the Forest of Mir.  You'll no longer be fighting just the occasional mummy here after dealing with the fixed encounters...</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Saradush Prison</strong><br/>
  At this point in the game, most vampires aren't much of a threat anymore to the party.  So this modification beefs most of the vampires encountered in the old prison to at least ancient level, and adds a few other epic-level undead.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Watcher's Keep</strong><br/>
  This component makes a few changes to Watcher's Keep.  The Thieves' Hood can now be obtained even if your PC is a paladin, and it's no longer needed to bargain with fiends for it.  Secondly, a few of the items in Saladrex' hoard can now be stolen by a skilled enough thief, you no longer have to kill him if you don't want to.  The spawn points on the Machine of Lum the Mad level will now spawn an assortment of stronger and more appropriate monsters.</p>
  <h3>Monster Corrections &amp; Improvements</h3>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Ankhegs</strong><br/>
  Ankhegs now have 18/50 strength and favor melee attacks.  Their hit die are raised to 8 making them immune to sleep.  They now get a P&amp;P correct acid spit when they lose 50% of their hit points (8d4 acid, save vs. breath for half).  This makes them fairly dangerous, especially in numbers.  This component also enhances the ankheg pit dungeon (farmer Brun's quest) by making ankhegs of varying hit dice (3-8) spawn constantly while you are there.  This place is now pretty dangerous, you might want to invest in protecion against acid.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Basilisks</strong><br/>
  When you are protected against petrification (which can be done with a simple potion or 1st level wizard spell), basilisks are way too easy.  This component gives greater basilisks at least their P&amp;P ability to breathe a deadly gas cloud that will affect anyone who engages them in melee, making them quite a bit more dangerous.  You may want to invest in protection from poison, or use ranged weapons.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Dread Wolves</strong><br/>
  These are way too easy for the 650 xp they are worth.  According to P&amp;P rules, dread wolves regenerate like trolls and can only be killed by acid, fire or complete dismemberment.  This component gives them that regeneration, when they reach 0 hp they will fall over as if dead, but will get up again unless you finish them with fire or acid.  However, unlike trolls they only get up once, if you knock them down again I assume they are completely dismembered.  They also gain their diseased bite, the disease will do one damage per hour until cured.  Dread wolves are now also marked as undead and can be turned.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Mustard Jellies</strong><br/>
  This component corrects the abilities and immunities of mustard jellies to more closely match P&amp;P.  Mustard jellies aren't supposed to be immune to spells (that's ochre jellies), they have 10% magic resistance and are immune to magic missile and lightning.  Their attack is now a touch attack that deals 5d4 acid damage, but it no longer slows and poisons.  This has been moved to the vapor cloud they generate, which induces slowness and lethargy.  They are also given their 90% stealth and will attempt to hide while not in melee.  I'm still working on their ability to split.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Winter Wolves</strong><br/>
  This component gives winter wolves their proper frost breath.  Instead of a ranged attack it's now a spell effect, save vs. breath for half damage.  Because you encounter these fairly early, I've kept it single target out of mercy.  Winter wolves now are fairly deadly for a low-level party so you may want to be really careful around them.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Wraith Spiders</strong><br/>
  This component corrects wraith spiders' attack, they will now actually drain a level and constitution instead of strength, as per P&amp;P.  Getting bitten by a wraith spider is now fairly dangerous for a low-level character, especially if there's more than one.  Wraith spiders are now also undead and thus can be turned.</p>
